# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis
This script will predict the sentimental value of a movie review and output a number 0 to 1 (negative to positive), indicating the sentiment.

**How does it work?**

It utilizes a trained model provided by Keras known as the IMDb dataset, which is trained by movie reviews left on IMDb. The script then preprocesses the text and tokenizes it, and feeds it into the trained model. Finally, we are left with a value that can tell us the sentiment of the movie review.

**How do I run it?**

Install the Tensorflow library and put whatever movie review you would like into text.txt. The one provided is just a sample review.
